    <h1>01 - Basic Rendering</h1>
    <p>
        Thumbnail and Page models are the basic units of document viewer.
        Basically all what DV does - it displays a collection of pages (with
        their thumbnail version on the side).
    </p>
    <p>
    This usecase makes sure that at very least you can instanciate both Page
    and Thumbnail Models and render them. Notice that both pages and its thumnail, at this point, <strong>do not feature</strong> any "preview image". Loading preview image in introduced in a later usecase.
    </p>

        Result:

    <div class="example">
        <div id="thumbnail"></div>
        <div id="page"></div>
    </div>
  </main>
