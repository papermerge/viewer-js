class Breadcrumb extends Model {
    /**
    Breadcrumb indicates the current browsingâ€™s location
    within a navigational hierarchy.

    Example:

    / Home / My Documents / Payments / Invoices

    Breadcrumb model is represented by an collection of Folder models.
    The leftmost folder in the breadcrumb is called root Folder (in example
    above /Home/ folder is the root folder).
    The rightmost folder in thr breadcrumb is called parent Folder (in example
    above /Invoices/ is parent folder).
    If breadcrumb is regarded as an array then folders closer to
    the root have lower indexes:

    Breadcrumb:               / Home / My Documents / Payments / Invoices

    Collection node indexes:  undefined / 0 / 1 / 2
    Notice that there is no node for root folder, which means that
    breadcrumb with 4 items (see example above), collection will
    have 3 folders:
        Folder(title=My Documents) - with index 0
        Folder(title=Payments) - with index 1
        Folder(title=Invoices) - with index 2

    First item in breadcrumb (My Documents) is accessible via first() method.
    Last item in breadcrumb (Invoices) is accessible via last() method.

        argument folder the last one in collection.

        If given folder is `undefined` - means the whole node's collection
        will be emptied. From user point of view - he/she chose to navigate
        to the root folder.

        If given folder is not equal to any of the nodes present in collection
        then - it means that use chose to navigate one folder "deeper".

        If given folder matches one of the nodes from `this.nodes` collection
        it means that user clicked on intermediary navigation path on the
        breadcrumb - in this case we need to throw away whatever breadcrumb
        elements were after given folder.
